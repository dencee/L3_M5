     * Recursion Basics:
     * Recursion is a method calling itself over and over instead of using loops.
     * The cycle starts when the method is originally called.
     * 
     * countDown(5);
     * 
     * This method, in its return statement then calls itself again restarting the cycle.
     * 
     * return countDown(5-1); ---> countDown(4);
     * 
     * The full cycle of countDown(5);
     *  return countDown(4)
     *      return countDown(3)
     *          return countDown(2)
     *              return countDown(1)
     *                  return countDown(0)
     *                      return 0; The cycle ends here because the original method isn't called again.
